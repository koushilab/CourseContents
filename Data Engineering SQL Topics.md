   - FROM clause.
   - WHERE clause.
   - DISTINCT keyword.

3. **Data Types**
   - Common SQL data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE).
   - Data type constraints.

### Intermediate SQL Concepts
4. **SQL Functions**
   - Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).
   - Scalar functions (UCASE, LCASE, ROUND, NOW).
   - Date and time functions.

5. **Joins**
   - INNER JOIN.
   - LEFT JOIN.
   - RIGHT JOIN.
   - FULL JOIN.
   - CROSS JOIN.
   - Self-joins.

6. **Grouping and Aggregating Data**
   - GROUP BY clause.
   - HAVING clause.
   - Using aggregate functions with GROUP BY.

7. **Subqueries**
   - Simple subqueries.
   - Correlated subqueries.
   - Using subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.

### Advanced SQL Concepts
8. **Set Operations**
   - UNION and UNION ALL.
   - INTERSECT.
   - EXCEPT.

9. **Window Functions**
   - OVER() clause.

   - ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK().
   - LEAD() and LAG().

10. **Advanced Joins and Complex Queries**
    - Multiple joins.
    - Nested joins.
    - Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

11. **Indexes and Performance Tuning**
    - Importance of indexes.
    - Creating and managing indexes.
    - Query optimization techniques.

### Data Manipulation
12. **Data Insertion, Updating, and Deletion**
    - INSERT INTO.
    - UPDATE.
    - DELETE.
    - MERGE statement.

13. **Transactions and Concurrency Control**
    - ACID properties.
    - BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK.
    - Isolation levels.

### SQL in Data Engineering Context
